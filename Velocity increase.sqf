// Set a static velocity to any vehicle. The vehicle moves where the player is looking at, so doesn't work well while in a turret of a tank for example.

// By placing another trigger that changes the value of Cease to 1, you can stop the script from running
// variables:
// NewVelocity = Wanted speed in km/h
// Cease = check to stop the script, 0 = false, 1 = true
