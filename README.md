# Arma-3-scripts
- This repository is for all of the scripts I write for Arma 3.
- The repository is structured in a way where the scripts are categorized via branches.
- Feel free to use these as you please.
- I try to write the scripts in a way where anyone can use them, regardless of their programming background.
- Most of the scripts work by placing the code in to a trigger, or the init field of a trigger or an AI unit.
